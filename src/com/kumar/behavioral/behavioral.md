| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass request along a chain of handlers                                   | Logging, event handling, middleware pipelines     |
| **Command**                 | Encapsulate requests as objects                                          | Undo/redo, queue of tasks                         |
| **Interpreter**             | Define grammar and interpretation rules                                  | Expression parsing (like SQL, regex, calculators) |
| **Iterator**                | Provide a way to access elements sequentially without exposing structure | Collection traversal (e.g., List, Set)            |
| **Mediator**                | Centralize communication between objects                                 | Chatroom, UI form controls                        |
| **Memento**                 | Capture and restore object state                                         | Undo functionality in editors                     |
| **Observer**                | Notify dependent objects of state changes                                | Event systems, GUI listeners, pub/sub             |
| **State**                   | Allow an object to alter behavior when its state changes                 | Vending machines, game characters, workflows      |
| **Strategy**                | Define a family of interchangeable algorithms                            | Sorting, compression, pathfinding strategies      |
| **Template Method**         | Define skeleton of algorithm, let subclasses override steps              | Game loops, report generation                     |
| **Visitor**                 | Add operations to object structure without changing classes              | AST processing, compilers, file system processing |
