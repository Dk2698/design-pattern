# Singleton Design Pattern

## Overview

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to this instance. This pattern is useful for managing shared resources where only a single instance is needed across the entire application.

## Problem Solved

The Singleton pattern addresses two main problems:

1. **Single Instance Requirement**: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and used throughout the application.
2. **Global Access**: Provides a global point of access to the unique instance, making it available from anywhere in the application.

## Implementation in Java

### Basic Singleton Implementation

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the Singleton pattern in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {

    // Private static instance of the class
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    // Public method to provide access to the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
